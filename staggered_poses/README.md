This work is an extension of staggered poses method in computer animation, the original work can be found at (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1632612).

I also presented this work on poster session of TTI's robotics workshop, the poster can be found at:

This code mainly focuses on how to find staggered poses frames (like essential frames) in a human motion with input of differnet channels of signals (force, encoder value, position, and orientation for this current version).
