# IMU calibration work
This is the work I implement Lavelle's headset paper (http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/~lavalle/papers/LavYerKatAnt14.pdf).

I wrote this code a while ago, I'm not sure if this version is totally correct so it's good for you to read the paper I linked and double check this code. If you need, I can walk through the code with you.
