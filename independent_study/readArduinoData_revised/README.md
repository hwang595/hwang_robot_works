# IMU Data Reader and Communicator with Laptop
This is a simple IMU 9250 data reader using a built in processing module. (Note that, this can avoid the drift of Euler angle in Yaw direction for you but the sample rate for the signal can be quite low).

Please write you own data/signal processing code if you want everything appropriate for your application.
